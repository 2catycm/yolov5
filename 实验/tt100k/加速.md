# API NOT FINAL
# default: optimizes for large models, low compile-time
#          and no extra memory usage
torch.compile(model)

# reduce-overhead: optimizes to reduce the framework overhead
#                and uses some extra memory. Helps speed up small models
torch.compile(model, mode="reduce-overhead")

# max-autotune: optimizes to produce the fastest model,
#               but takes a very long time to compile
torch.compile(model, mode="max-autotune")
